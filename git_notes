Git Notes 

Step 1:  Download Git Bash
Step 2:  Set up username and email in the git bash terminal 
	     git config -global user.name “June Li”
         git config -global user.email xxx@gmail.com

Step 3: Initialize a local repo
•	Go to local directory or make a directory: cd dir
•	Point to the local directory and initialize git: git init
•	Add all file in the local dir to git: git add . 
•	Show status: git status
•	Check log: git log
•	Commit: git commit -m “comments”
•	Enter commands on notepad++
•	Check log: git log
•	git remote add origin: https://github.com/miaojunlee/xxx 
•	Update local repo to make sure local repo has up to date with the remote repo: git pull origin master (always do a pull before push)
•	Push the remote repo (origin) under the master branch: git push -u origin master 

Clone 
•	Git clone repo url 

Merge
To merge local repo with an existing git repo
•	git remote add origin: https://github.com/miaojunlee/xxx 
•	Run a pull first: git pull –allowed-unrelated-histories
•	Set branch: git branch –set -upstream-to=origin/master master 
•	Push files: git push 


To edit global config file
•	Go to master directory: cd 
•	npp .gitconfig 

To combine add and commit into one line: git commit -am “comments”

To track a file: git ls-files (ls list files in the local directory, git ls-files lists files in git staging) 

To remove a stage change: git reset HEAD filename 

Recover File
To recover a deleted file but still available in staging: git checkout filename 
To backout changes: git checkout --filename
To recover a deleted file that has also been committed: 

1.	git log to find the key
2.	git checkout 04f788928d8b2b9ea5c1cc6b945b4ce15aa1f033^ --  testv2.txt
3.	to read the file from git: git show HEAD:filename 

•	git rm filename 
•	To un-staged the delete: git reset HEAD filename (spell it out) (this is considered a staging change)
•	To recover the file from staging: Git checkout -- filename 


Rename
•	To rename the current file name: git mv oldfilename newfilename
•	To rename the name at the system level: mv oldname newname
•	Git add -A (recursively add changes but also update any file that has been renamed, moved or deleted)

Delete File
•	Delete a file not being tracked by git: rm file
•	Delete a file being tracked by git: git rm file, followed by git commit

Delete files using bash command: 
•	rm filename
•	git add -A
•	git commit

To remove folder: rm -rf foldername (be very careful with this change)

History
•	git log
•	git log --abbrev-commit
•	git log --all --oneline --graph –decorate
•	git log e36c22c...55bd792
•	git log --since=”3 days ago”
•	git log --filename 
•	git show commitID

Alias
•	git config --global alias.hist “git --all --oneline --graph --decorate”

Ignore Unwanted File
•	npp .gitignore 

How to make Git “forget” about a file that was tracked but is now in .gitignore: git rm --cached *.pptx

Streamline commit: git commit -am "commit message"

Comparisons: P4Merge
- Download from perforce.com find P4Merge (windows 64-bit)
- Set environment variable under advanced settings (add the path of P4Merge to the path) 
- To compare files between staging and working directory: git difftool 
- To compare working directory and the staging area(last commit): git difftool HEAD
- To compare between staging area and the Git Repo: git diff --staged HEAD 
- To compare between staging area and the git repo on a single file: git difftool --staged HEAD -- test_python_code.ipynb
- To compare against different commit: git diff HEAD HEAD^ | git diff commitkey1 commitkey2
- To compare between local and remote master branches: git difftool master origin/master

 
To config P4Merge as the default tool: 
git config --global -e

Add this line: 
[diff]
	tool = p4merge

Branching & Merging
- list all local branches: git branch
- list all branches including remote branches: git branch -a
- create a new branch: git branch newbranch
- switch branch: git checkout newbranch
- rename branch: git branch -m newbranch mynewbranch
- to delete branch: git branch -d newbranch
- create a new branch and switch to the new branch: git checkout -b newbranch (at this point all the changes are made under newbranch)
- compare between different branches: git difftool master newbranch 
- merge with the new branch: 1) switch it back to master 2) git merge newbranch -m "commit message"
- merge commit with fast forward disabled : git merge master newbranch --no-ff 
- after merge, delete the old branch and create another one. Reset timeline.
- automatic merge:

Merge conflict and resolution:
- first run: git merge newbranch (if there's conflict it will be reported CONFLICT)
- when merging with conflict: git mergetool, manually pick the changes you want to make, save the changes
- run this: git commit -am "resolve conflict"


=======


…or create a new repository on the command line
echo "# tensorflow_bootcamp" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/miaojunlee/tensorflow_bootcamp.git
git push -u origin master
…or push an existing repository from the command line
git remote add origin https://github.com/miaojunlee/tensorflow_bootcamp.git
git push -u origin master
…or import code from another repository
You can initialize this repository with code from a Subversion, Mercurial, or TFS project.


You can also use git init project_name 
List all files including hidden files : ls – al
Rm -rf foldername 
•	To copy repo from others: find a repo and click on fork; go to Git Bash and type in git clone url 
•	To go to the git folder: cd .git/
•	To remove a file from git staging: git rm –cached filename
•	To ignore the files from git add ., type: npp .gitignore (list the files want to ignore in the notepad++)
•	To manually add a file that listed in the .gitignore, use: git add -f filename 
•	To remove a repo on Github, go to Danger Zone and delete the repo; also, on Git Bash: git remove remote origin 
•	When encounter remote commit has more files than local, use: git pull
